# Astro

[official docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/mpa-vs-spa/)

Multi-Page Application (MPA) framework.
- multi HTML pages rendered on the server-side
- routing login lives in the server
- use [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/) for offering a seamless transitions between pages 
- server state management

Trade off vs. SPA
- renders slower the second, third page load

**Astro Island**
- component islands
- always renders in isolation
- build on <u><i>partial</i></u> or <u><i>selective hydration</i></u>
- only loads JS for components that need it
- parallel loading
- you controll how and when to render each component


**Sharing state**
- [Nano Stores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores/discussions) - shared client-side storage



With TypeScript: configure *astro.config.mjs* [doc](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/configuring-astro/#the-astro-config-file)


Astro is very cool!
